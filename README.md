# Fingerprint Database
Dataset comprises **6,000+** fingerprint images from **100** individuals, each paired with 5-7 distorted or latent versions to simulate real-world forensic challenges. It is designed for **fingerprint identification**, **recognition systems**, and **forensic investigations**, offering a robust resource for **biometric data analysis**, criminal investigations, and **automated fingerprint matching**.

By leveraging this dataset, researchers and law enforcement agencies can enhance **fingerprint recognition algorithms**, improve **identification processes**, and advance forensic sciences. - **[Get the data](https://unidata.pro/datasets/forensic-fingerprint-dataset/?utm_source=github-org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=forensic-fingerprint-dataset)**

Manually annotated latent-to-reference pairs enable precise training for fingerprint enhancement algorithms and AFIS (Automated Fingerprint Identification System) improvements.
